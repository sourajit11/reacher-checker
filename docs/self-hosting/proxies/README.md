# Proxies

Maintaining a good IP reputation is hard. Reacher integrates seamlessly with SOCKS5 proxies.

## What is a SOCKS5 Proxy?

A **SOCKS5 proxy** is a flexible proxy protocol that supports various types of traffic, including SMTP. When using it for email verifications, the reputation of the **proxyâ€™s IP** is what matters, not your own IP. This is crucial for maintaining deliverability and avoiding issues like blacklisting.

Choosing a reputable 3rd-party proxy will greatly improve the quality of your email verification results. For a list of recommended proxies, see [#which-3rd-party-proxies-does-reacher-recommend](./#which-3rd-party-proxies-does-reacher-recommend "mention")

SMTP email verifications are not possible via a traditional HTTP proxy.
{% endhint %}

## Setting up a Proxy

Once you've purchased a proxy, run the Docker command (see how in [install.md](../install.md "mention")) and pass the following flags:

* `-e RCH__PROXY__HOST=<host>`: The IP or hostname of the proxy server.
* `-e RCH__PROXY__PORT=<port>`: The corresponding port.
* `-e RCH__PROXY__USERNAME=<username>`: Optional. A username to authenticate the proxy.
* `-e RCH__PROXY__PASSWORD=<password>`: Optional. The corresponding password.
* `-e RCH__HELLO_NAME=<domain>`: The identifier to use during the "HELO/EHLO" step. It should match a domain name owned by the proxy. Ask your proxy provider about this setting.
* `-e RCH__FROM_EMAIL=<email>`: The email to use during the "MAIL FROM" step. It should be an email from the same domain as the HELLO\_NAME. Ask your proxy provider about this setting.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're using the [commercial-license-trial.md](../licensing/commercial-license-trial.md "mention"), these fields are already populated with the built-in proxy. However, you can overwrite them by passing these flags again, pointing to a proxy of your own choosing.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For advanced usage, you can configure [multiple-proxies.md](multiple-proxies.md "mention").

## Which 3rd-party proxies does Reacher recommend?

Reacher has been working closely with [Proxy4Smtp](https://www.proxy4smtp.com) since early 2024. The service is run by Jon, an email verification expert who has had over 10 years experience in the industry. He understands the complications and challenges that arise from large scale SMTP connections. His proxies integrate seamlessly with Reacher, and are tailored for B2B emails.
